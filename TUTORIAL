| Twurl |
+-------+

Twurl is like CUrl, but tailored specifically for the Twitter API.
It knows how to grant an access token to a client application for
a specified user and then sign all requests with that access token.

It also provides other development and debugging conveniences such
as defining aliases for common requests, as well as support for
multiple access tokens to easily switch between different client
applications and Twitter accounts.

+-----------------+
| Getting Started |
+-----------------+

The first thing you have to do is register an OAuth application
to get a consumer key and secret.

  http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new

When you have your consumer key and its secret you authorize
your Twitter account to make API requests with your consumer key
and secret.

  % twurl authorize -u username -p password      \
                    --consumer-key the_key       \
                    --consumer-secret the_secret

Assuming your username, password, key and secret are all correct
you are now authorized to make requests with the API. Twurl
will tell you as much.

+-----------------+
| Making Requests |
+-----------------+

The simplest request just requires that you specify the path you
want to request.

  % twurl /1/statuses/home_timeline.xml

Similar to curl, a GET request is performed by default.

You can implicitly perform a POST request by passing the -d option,
which specifies POST parameters.

  % twurl -d 'status=Testing twurl' /1/statuses/update.xml

You can explicitly specify what request method to perform with
the -X (or --request-method) option.

  % twurl -X DELETE /1/statuses/destroy/123456.xml

+------------------+
| Creating aliases |
+------------------+

  % twurl alias h /1/statuses/home_timeline.xml

You can then use "h" in place of the full path.

  % twurl h

Paths that require additional options such as request parameters for example can
be used with aliases the same as with full explicit paths, just as you might
expect.

  % twurl alias tweet /1/statuses/update.xml
  % twurl tweet -d "status=Aliases in twurl are convenient"
