| Getting Started |
+-----------------+

The first thing you have to do is register an OAuth application
to get a consumer key and secret.

When you have your consumer key and its secret you authorize
your Twitter account to make API requests with your consumer key
and secret.

  % twurl authorize -u username -p password      \
                    --consumer-key the_key       \
                    --consumer-secret the_secret

Assuming your username, password, key and secret are all correct
you are now authorized to make requests with the API.

+-----------------+
| Making Requests |
+-----------------+

The simplest request just requires that you specify the path you
want to request.

  % twurl /1/statuses/home_timeline.xml

Similar to curl, a GET request is performed by default.

You can implicitly perform a POST request by passing the -d option.

  % twurl -d 'status=Testing twurl' /1/statuses/update.xml

You can explicitly specify what request method to perform with
the -X (or --request-method) option.

  % twurl -X DELETE /1/statuses/destroy/123456.xml

+------------------+
| Creating aliases |
+------------------+

  % twurl alias h /1/statuses/home_timeline.xml

You can then use "h" in place of the full path.

  % twurl h

Paths that require additional options such as request parameters for example can
be used with aliases the same as with full explicit paths, just as you might
expect.

  % twurl alias tweet /1/statuses/update.xml
  % twurl tweet -d "status=Aliases in twurl are convenient"
